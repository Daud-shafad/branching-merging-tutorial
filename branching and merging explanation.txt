Branching of the git and github explanation:-
___e.g: our manager comes and asks us to add a bug fix for the website, the way to solve this problem is to use a feature
of git called branching, you can think of branching as you are sort of creating a copy of your version history, but then
you can add commits to the copy instead of your main version history that you had before, and the advantage of this is that
you can add all the commits that you want to the copy while you are working on the feature, before your feature is done
and while you are still working on your feature you can add bug fixes to your original version history. this lets you
create bug fixes and lets you put the bug fixes on your real website, without having your new feature and your work in 
progress code getting in the way.
