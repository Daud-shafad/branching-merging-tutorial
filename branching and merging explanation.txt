Branching of the git explanation:-

what is branching in git?

___e.g: our manager comes and asks us to add a bug fix for the website, the way to solve this problem is to use a feature
of git called branching, you can think of branching as you are sort of creating a copy of your version history, but then
you can add commits to the copy instead of your main version history that you had before, and the advantage of this is that
you can add all the commits that you want to the copy while you are working on the feature, before your feature is done
and while you are still working on your feature you can add bug fixes to your original version history. this lets you
create bug fixes and lets you put the bug fixes on your real website, without having your new feature and your work in 
progress code getting in the way.
___this feature or branching allows you can work multiple things on the same time, e.g: two or more features at the same time and or a feature and a bug fix
or even sometimes more than two features.

Merging of the git and explanation:-
____________________________________
what is merging in git?

___e.g: we have another problem when we use it branching, we eventually want to combine all of our changes together,
so let's say that we are working on a feature in a separate branch just like this, we don't really want this feature to be
in this separate branch forever right? we eventually want to put this feature, as well as a bug fix, all into our code.
so how do we do that? well git provides us another tool that helps us combine all of these  separate branches. and this
tool is called merging. merging is actually pretty easy to understand.
e.g: you have two files you are changing in different positions how can we do merging of these files? we do you are just
taking the changes of these two files or you just taking changes from one branch and also changes from another branch
and you just combining the changes together. that is what merging is.
___in here there is two questions?
1)where does the result of the merge go? does it go on top of the feature one branch, or does it go on top of the massive
branch? or does it go somewhere else entirely?
answer): the answer is that when you merge two branches together, the result will go on to the branch that you are 
currently working on. and the branch that you are working on you can know it(waxad ku garan kartaa branchka aad joogto) where the head is pointing to.
which means the branch of the head.
___so if you merge your branch and master together then the result of that is going to be another commit on top of your branch.

2)where should we put our merge result? should the merge result go on top of the feature one branch, or should it go
on top of the master branch?
answer): there is nothing really enforces you to put the merge results on either branche, so git doesn't have really 
a rules here, but generally within a company if you're working on a team they like to use the main branch or the master
branch as sort of a final copy of the code that is eventually going to go  to the website, so that is why we want to put
all of our changes, we want to merge all of our changes back into the master branch. this is sort of the final copy of
our code.
